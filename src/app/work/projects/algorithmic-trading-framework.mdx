## Overview

A production-grade framework for developing, testing, and deploying quantitative trading strategies. Built on the **RBI (Research-Backtest-Implement)** methodology, this system ensures rigorous validation before any strategy goes live.

## The RBI Methodology

### Research Phase
**Evidence-Based Development**
- Review academic papers and market analysis
- Identify statistical edges
- Document trading rules clearly
- Formulate testable hypotheses

### Backtest Phase  
**Rigorous Historical Validation**
- Multi-timeframe testing (1min to 1day)
- Transaction cost modeling (commissions, slippage)
- Realistic order execution simulation
- Walk-forward optimization
- Out-of-sample testing
- Statistical significance testing

### Implement Phase
**Controlled Deployment**
- Start with minimal positions ($10)
- Paper trading validation
- Monitor for 2 weeks minimum
- Scale gradually based on performance
- Continuous risk monitoring

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Backtesting Engine**: Historical validation with realistic market conditions
- **Multi-Strategy Portfolio**: Simultaneous testing and optimization of multiple strategies
- **Risk Management Framework**: Position sizing, stop-loss, portfolio heat limits
- **Performance Analytics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate calculations
- **Clean Code Architecture**: Modular design with base strategy classes

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**: Core framework language
- **Pandas**: Time series data manipulation
- **NumPy**: High-performance numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: Strategy performance visualization
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Strategy inheritance and polymorphism

## Technical Implementation

The framework implements a clean inheritance structure where all strategies extend a `BaseStrategy` class. Each strategy defines entry/exit rules while the backtesting engine handles:
- Historical data management
- Order execution simulation
- Position tracking
- P&L calculation
- Performance metrics

Example mean reversion strategy demonstrates the framework's flexibility - implements Bollinger Bands with RSI confirmation, complete with parameter optimization and comprehensive logging.

## Challenges and Learnings

**Challenge**: Accurately modeling slippage and transaction costs in backtests.  
**Solution**: Implemented realistic slippage models based on order size and market volatility, ensuring backtest results reflect real trading conditions.

**Challenge**: Preventing overfitting during optimization.  
**Solution**: Enforced walk-forward optimization with out-of-sample testing, requiring strategies to perform on unseen data.

## Performance Metrics Tracked

- **Returns**: Total return, annualized return, monthly returns
- **Risk**: Volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown
- **Trade Statistics**: Win rate, average win/loss, profit factor, expectancy
- **Execution**: Fill rates, slippage analysis

## Outcome

This framework demonstrates deep understanding of quantitative finance, software architecture for financial applications, and rigorous testing methodologies. The RBI approach ensures only robust, well-validated strategies make it to production.

The system has been used to develop and test multiple strategies across different asset classes, with comprehensive documentation enabling rapid iteration and improvement.
