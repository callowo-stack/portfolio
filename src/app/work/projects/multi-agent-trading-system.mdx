## Overview

A production-grade AI trading framework that employs multiple specialized agents working collaboratively to analyze markets and generate high-confidence trading signals. Each agent represents a distinct investment philosophy or analytical approach, creating a robust multi-perspective analysis system.

## Architecture

The system implements a hierarchical multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to make informed trading decisions:

**Investment Philosophy Agents:**
- **Value Agent**: Identifies undervalued assets with strong fundamentals
- **Growth Agent**: Focuses on high-potential disruptive companies
- **Momentum Agent**: Captures trending market movements
- **Contrarian Agent**: Finds opportunities in market inefficiencies

**Analysis Agents:**
- **Fundamentals Agent**: Analyzes financial statements and metrics
- **Technicals Agent**: Processes price action and technical indicators
- **Sentiment Agent**: Evaluates market sentiment from news and social data
- **Risk Manager**: Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits

**Orchestration:**
- **Portfolio Manager**: Synthesizes all signals and makes final decisions

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Diverse perspectives through specialized agents with weighted voting system
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Combines fundamental, technical, and sentiment analysis with risk assessment
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Signal aggregation, dynamic position sizing, and portfolio optimization
- **Extensible Framework**: Modular design for easy addition of new agents or strategies

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Abstract base classes, inheritance, type hints

## Technical Highlights

Implemented clean OOP architecture with abstract base classes ensuring consistent agent interfaces. Each agent maintains its own signal history for performance tracking. The system uses a consensus mechanism where agents vote on trading actions, with the portfolio manager making final decisions based on weighted agreement thresholds.

The technical agent alone implements multiple indicators (SMA, RSI, volume analysis) with intelligent signal weighting and confidence scoring. All agents follow the same `analyze()` interface but implement their own unique methodologies.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing agent diversity while maintaining decision coherence was a key challenge. The solution involved implementing a weighted voting system with minimum consensus thresholds and allowing the risk manager to provide final safety checks.

Another challenge was making agents interpretable - each signal includes detailed reasoning and metadata, allowing for full transparency in decision-making.

## Outcome

This project demonstrates advanced software architecture skills, multi-agent system design, and practical application of AI in finance. The modular framework allows for easy extension and testing of new trading strategies while maintaining robust risk management.
